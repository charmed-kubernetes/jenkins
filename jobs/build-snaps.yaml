# Builds and releases latest snaps

- job-template:
    name: 'build-release-cdk-addons-{arch}-{version}'
    description: |
      Builds, releases and promotes cdk-addons for supported k8s versions on {arch} to the snapstore.
      Container images required by CDK are known during the build, so this job also tags and pushes
      those to the Canonical image registry.

      The full version of the cdk-addons snap is tied to the upstream k8s tag used during the build.
      Explicitly set this with the `k8s_tag` parameter, or this job will determine it using the
      `version` parameter and the contents of https://dl.k8s.io/release/[stable|latest]-`version`.txt.

      If all `build-release-cdk-addons-$arch-$ver` jobs appear to stall during snap upload, check
      for a revision for which the auto-approver has hung by logging into
      https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/snaps/cdk-addons/ with cdkbot@gmail ubuntu lastpass creds
      and manually rejecting the review for the oldest hung revision.
