# Builds and releases latest snaps

- job-template:
    name: 'build-release-cdk-addons-{version}'
    description: |
      Builds and uploads cdk-addons for supported k8s versions to the snapstore.
      Container images required by CK are known during the build, so this job
      also tags and pushes those to the Canonical image registry.

      The full version of the cdk-addons snap is tied to the upstream k8s tag
      used during the build. Explicitly set this with the `k8s_tag` parameter,
      or this job will determine it using the `version` parameter and the
      contents of https://dl.k8s.io/release/[stable|latest]-`version`.txt.

      If all `build-release-cdk-addons-$ver` jobs appear to stall during snap
      upload, check for a revision for which the auto-approver has hung by
      logging into https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/snaps/cdk-addons/ with
      cdkbot@gmail ubuntu lastpass creds. Manually reject the review for the
      oldest hung revision.
