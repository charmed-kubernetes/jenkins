      Builds, releases and promotes cdk-addons for supported k8s versions on {arch} to the snapstore.
      Container images required by CDK are known during the build, so this job also tags and pushes
      those to the Canonical image registry.

      The full version of the cdk-addons snap is tied to the upstream k8s tag used during the build.
      Explicitly set this with the `k8s_tag` parameter, or this job will determine it using the
      `version` parameter and the contents of https://dl.k8s.io/release/[stable|latest]-`version`.txt.
