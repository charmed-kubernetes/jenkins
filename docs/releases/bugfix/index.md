# Creating a bugfix release
Performs a Kubernetes bugfix release, which includes validation across the base
deployment as well as variations including calico, tigera, vault, nvidia, and
ceph.

## Bugfix Release Process

### Cherry-pick / backport relevant PRs

Cherry-pick relevant PRs for charm repos into stable branch, and
backport relevant PRs for cdk-addons to the appropriate release
branch(es).

There is a script to run to tag all bugs in the milestone with
a `backport-needed` tag. This is then removed by the person who
cherry-pick or backports all PRs listed in that bug once complete.

### Document release notes

Create a PR against the [docs repo][] with release notes including:

- Bugfixes
- Enhancements
- Known Limitations/Issues

[docs repo]: https://github.com/charmed-kubernetes/kubernetes-docs

### Verify repos, branches

Make sure that all stable branches are being referenced from
charmed-kubernetes repo and that charm pull-source is bringing in the
correct repos/branches. This requires reporting that will provide an
overview of the status of all forked/maintained repos and their branches in
addition to verifying that the layer index is pointing to the correct repos
during build.

### Tag existing stable branches with bugfix release tag

**Job**: https://jenkins.canonical.com/k8s/job/sync-stable-tag-bugfix-rev/

This will tag all stable repos with the k8s version and bugfix revision
associated, for example, the first bugfix release of 1.16 would be
**1.16+ck1**

#### Charm tag options

### Run the **build-charms** job

**Job**: https://jenkins.canonical.com/k8s/job/build-charms/

This will build and promote the stable charms to candidate channel for testing.

#### Charm build options

### Verify Commit SHAs of charms/layers/interfaces

Verify the charm manifests for the build charms matches the commit SHAs of
the stable branches of what was built in the previous build-charms job.

### Run **validate-charm-bugfix** job

**Job**: https://jenkins.canonical.com/k8s/job/validate-charm-bugfix/

This validates the deployment using the charms from candidate channel.

### Promote charms from **candidate** to **stable**

**Job**: https://jenkins.canonical.com/k8s/job/promote-charms/

This job takes a tag, from_channel, and to_channel. The tag defaults to `k8s` so
it will only promote the necessary charms that make up charmed-kuberneetes (the
others are kubeflow related).

### Promote bundles from **candidate** to **stable**

**Job**: https://jenkins.canonical.com/k8s/job/promote-bundles/

Same as charm promotion.

### Promote cdk-addons

Promote **cdk-addons** snap from edge to proper snap channels for ck release.

### Send announcement to k8s-crew with any relevant information.
