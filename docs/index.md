# Charm Kubernetes Jenkins

This project contains the scripts used to build and test the CDK.

## What is where

 - *jobs* - All jenkins jobs housed here
 - *jobs/integration* - All integration tests housed here

## How to run tests locally

Running the tests locally can be accomplished easily with tox. The tests expect
certain environment variables to be set. These can be found by looking at the
help output from `pytest` under the **custom options** section.

> **Note**: Required minimum Python version is 3.6.

```
> tox -e py3 --workdir .tox -- pytest jobs/integration/validation.py --help

custom options:
  --no-flaky-report     Suppress the report at the end of the run detailing
                        flaky test results.
  --no-success-flaky-report
                        Suppress reporting flaky test successesin the report
                        at the end of the run detailing flaky test results.
  --controller=CONTROLLER
                        Juju controller to use
  --model=MODEL         Juju model to use
  --series=SERIES       Base series
  --cloud=CLOUD         Juju cloud to use
  --charm-channel=CHARM_CHANNEL
                        Charm channel to use
  --bundle-channel=BUNDLE_CHANNEL
                        Bundle channel to use
  --snap-channel=SNAP_CHANNEL
                        Snap channel to use eg 1.16/edge
  --is-upgrade          This test should be run with snap and charm upgrades
  --upgrade-snap-channel=UPGRADE_SNAP_CHANNEL
                        Snap channel to use eg 1.16/edge
  --upgrade-charm-channel=UPGRADE_CHARM_CHANNEL
                        Charm channel to use (stable, candidate, beta, edge)
  --snapd-upgrade       run tests with upgraded snapd
  --snapd-channel=SNAPD_CHANNEL
                        Snap channel to install snapcore from
```

This tells us what the commandline is to run this test and what parameters we
need to pass to it. These are passed to pytest running in tox. By default, the
working directory for tox is in /var/lib/jenkins, which probably doesn't exist
on development machines, so --workdir is used to specify a new directory to use.

```
tox --workdir .tox -e py3 -- \
    pytest jobs/integration/validation.py \
      --controller aws-us-east-1 \
      --model cdk \
      --cloud aws 2>&1 | tee ~/log.txt
```

## Developing new tests

Jenkins Job Builder is used to generate jobs for Jenkins programmatically. No
jobs are created by hand in the Jenkins UI.

Adding a new test can be done by copying an existing one and modifying for your needs:

[JJB Validate](https://github.com/juju-solutions/kubernetes-jenkins/blob/master/jobs/validate.yaml)
