    ## Bugfix Release Process

    ### Cherry-pick fixes from master into stable branches

    ### Document release notes

    - Bugfixes
    - Enhancements
    - Known Limitations/Issues

    ### Verify repos, branches

    Make sure that all stable branches are being referenced from
    charmed-kubernetes repo and that charm pull-source is bringing in the
    correct repos/branches. This requires reporting that will provide an
    overview of the status of all forked/maintained repos and their branches in
    addition to verifying that the layer index is pointing to the correct repos
    during build.

    ### Tag existing stable branches with bugfix release tag

    **Job**: https://jenkins.canonical.com/k8s/job/sync-stable-tag-bugfix-rev/

    This will tag all stable repos with the k8s version and bugfix revision
    associated, for example, the first bugfix release of 1.16 would be
    **1.16+ck1**

    #### Charm tag options

    ### Run the **build-charms** job

    **Job**: https://jenkins.canonical.com/k8s/job/build-charms/

    This will build and promote the stable charms to candidate channel for testing.

    #### Charm build options

    ### Verify Commit SHAs of charms/layers/interfaces

    Verify the charm manifests for the build charms matches the commit SHAs of
    the stable branches of what was built in the previous build-charms job.

    ### Run **validate-charm-bugfix** job

    **Job**: https://jenkins.canonical.com/k8s/job/validate-charm-bugfix/

    This validates the deployment using the charms from candidate channel.

    ### Promote charms from **candidate** to **stable**

    **Job**: https://jenkins.canonical.com/k8s/job/promote-charms/

    This job takes a tag, from_channel, and to_channel. The tag defaults to `k8s` so
    it will only promote the necessary charms that make up charmed-kuberneetes (the
    others are kubeflow related).

    ### Promote bundles from **candidate** to **stable**

    **Job**: https://jenkins.canonical.com/k8s/job/promote-bundles/

    Same as charm promotion.

    ### Promote cdk-addons

    Promote **cdk-addons** snap from edge to proper snap channels for ck release.

    ### Send announcement to k8s-crew with any relevant information.
